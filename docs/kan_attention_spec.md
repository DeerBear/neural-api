# KAN Attention Normaliser — Design Specification

**Version:** v1 (mechanism-locked, pre-implementation)
**Scope:** language-independent design document

---

## 1. Abstract

A drop-in replacement for the softmax operator inside multi-head self-attention. The layer is trained entirely as standard softmax attention; at inference time a per-head B-spline normaliser (a "KAN edge") autonomously learns to mimic softmax, takes over the forward path per-layer when converged, and thereafter evolves to surface information that a fixed-shape softmax cannot express. Retrofits onto any pre-trained softmax transformer with no retraining.

**Non-goals:** KAN-ifying Q, K, V or output projections; replacing any part of training; supporting training-time gradient flow through the KAN normaliser.
